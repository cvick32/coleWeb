      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Man Who'd Gone Crazy looked back up at Muriel. His eyes looking more mad than Muriel had realized. He said our duty here on this earth is to look at how our tiny our little spheres of life are and laugh and smash them on the ground. He continued, we're not here to make any big decisions or change other people's lives. We're just here for ourselves. Just sit down and watch it go by until you see the crumbling roof of a hospital and you go back to God. The Man Who'd Gone Crazy had finished. Arthur didn't know what to make of his time spent with the man. He didn't even know that he was crazy. But he could feel and see it now. Some God other than the one we go to and come from had gotten into his bones, was searing his flesh from the inside. Burning him down from the inside. All these things the man said couldn't possibly be true. Of course Arthur had some control and some meaning and some ultimate purpose. Just that day he had come across a ball of dust and scraped it up from his immaculate floors. Just that day he'd bent down and plucked a pernicious weed from his neat garden. Just that day he'd wound his clocks and his body and his mind around with wires so they would stay on time for the rest of the day, until that night when it no longer mattered to anyone at all what became of either the time or of Arthur.
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">But Muriel couldn't shake the old man from his back all night and all day. He stayed at the lodge and the man who'd gone crazy would sit up and look at him all the while burning. Arthur tried to wrestle, tried to think of more reasons why he couldn't be the one who had no say what was done. Why he couldn't be the one to leave nothing behind. Why he couldn't be the only one whose entire world ends the day that he dies. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Couldn't the secret be too much for the rest of them to handle, thought the Man Who'd Gone Crazy. Too soon... too soon for Mister Muriel The Man whispered as he chuckled to himself. Too soon for tiny little Arthur whose mommy and daddy aren't here to protect him. And right before he ended his muttering he burst out in a wild cackle. He thought it all too funny that Muriel couldn't seem to get the joke. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Old Man Who'd Gone Crazy finally asked Muriel, as a sort of test, if he was ready to leave the lodge and go back to his neat home. Weary as he was, Arthur wasn't ready to leave yet. </span></p>

    <h3 style="background-image:url(https://dauldvick.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/sc223007.jpg?w=863)">CAVE DOOR OF SPRING</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:400;">It doesn't get dark anymore. All the thrown-away light sticks around long enough to bounce off the fresh snow. A certain reverence exists for the snow. It would be dirty as soon as it fell if they didn't. Usually the people affect their surroundings. They're forced to look at the reflections of all their grimy misdeeds and trespassings in the soot and the squalor. Their ephemeral perfection captured in the obvious meteorological metaphor. The perfect little person inside everyone's mind that has never done a thing wrong. The person who comes out when someone is getting high on ego. No amount of forgotten memories could will them to empathy. </span> <span style="font-weight:400;">People hate to walk on it. Scared to ruin its glittering perfection. Even the satisfying crunch won't fill them if they think they've soiled it. No, we will never be ready for Spring. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">But here I am ready to defile every inch. Ready to remind myself and everyone of what we have got in ourselves that is too dirty to air out on the clothesline. We like to get stuck in our caves. Our caves of self-rationalization and pity. But the snow piles up and all we're left with our perfect stories of ourselves. Porcelain people being self-manufactured. But t</span><span style="font-weight:400;">he snow needs to melt. We need imperfect creatures. We need the heat and the rain and the heavy, too-sweet smell of flowers. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">And here I am. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ready to open the Cave Door of Spring. </span></p>

    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:400;"><b><u>Male Headdress</u></b>
      Red black red black on and on fruitless. A stupid marionette on a chain. Wanting eyes pursed lips, a thief in the night. A prisoner of his own people forced to wear a scarlet headdress just so the people could be vindicated. A martyr. A bilesome martyr of time past, and traditions that should be long forgotten.

      </span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight:400"><b><u>Perry T Rathbone</u></b>
    This is the type of man who looks like he lives underwater. HIs cigarette is a safety flare and his hair gel a hellish amalgam of blubber and crude oil. He smirks because he knows he doesn’t deserve his tailored suit. He wears it anyway because he knows he must keep up appearances. He wrestles naked lonely with himself. He can’t stop thinking. He’s mad and that’s where he’s headed.
  </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight:400;">
    <b><u>Female Figure</u></b>
    The woman stood impregnated with guilt and worry. Chained at the ankles. She donned a sardonic mask from Ancient Greece, and told herself hey baby would be alright. Her breasts hung limp and empty, too many had touched them with wanting lips. The baby would be alright, chained at the ankles.
  </span>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">
    <b><u>Man in Museum with Love Interest</u></b>
    As he gives the walls a cursory glance he can’t help but tell her what paint they used and where the interesting parts are. She looks at him puzzled. There’s no painting in front of him.
</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">
    <b><u>Double Portrait</u></b>
    There’s blood in the bottle. They’ll tell you it’s scotch until your teeth rot out and the dentist stops answering your calls. But it’s blood. If they hand you a glass of wine, it’s their venom. Turn and run before your blood decants in their smoky hovel.

                <b><u>Dystopia</u></b>
What happens when ideas become words and words are stripped off the page into a vat of chemical heresy? Nothing. Ideas have been lost and are now being served as alphabet soup to a child. I wonder if it tastes good. I wonder, if he knew what the words meant, would he stop? I wonder if starving is worse than forgetting.
        </span> </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:400;">
        <b><u>Idea</u></b>
I know what I’m thinking, but I can’t put it into words. Every time I try to understand it calls in and says it’s sick. I know I’ll find out what I’m trying to tell myself one of these days. One day what I think will come out of me like poison.
          </span> </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:400;">
          <b><u>Boston Common at Dusk</u></b>
C’mon boy the ghosts are coming out. They like to see young boys like you. It reminds their tired minds of what flesh feels like on rotting bones. We’ll miss the train home if they grip you. I know you can’t help leaving tracks in the snow, but cover them up as best you can so as not to lead them to our den. They’ll want you until you’ve given them your life. Once they’ve haggled it down and gotten it they’ll be rid of you. They’ll suck out your life for sustenance and set your bones aflame. No one will remember you if they post boy isn’t around. So let’s get on back the ghosts are coming out.
            </span> </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:400;">
            <b><u>Ravine</u></b>
I’m deep in the marsh. Varying shades of grey and green selected randomly from a swatch by someone who didn’t think it mattered. It only mattered to me now. I was the one being coddled by its venomous vines. They could’ve been periwinkle for all he cared. At least I had tried. I can still see the sky tumbling over itself, asking why it turns. I’m dizzy she yells but the people just look through her at the stars. I’ve decided I’ll die in my trench turning with her. Two beings left behind staring at the one thing that can save them.
